				<p>Track and field started for Abdullahi Hassan in ninth grade. During gym class, he had to complete a 400m run against his classmates. He ran a time of 56 seconds which wiped away the field. His gym teacher convinces him to join track and field, and so Abdullahi decides to do so. By the end of freshman year, he had won many championships and became the fastest 800m running in Canada within his age group.<p>
